Thanks for your contribution.
The reason human beings could finally stand out to have evolved from lower forms of life to what they are now and developed human civilization is because they are always kept the spirit of exploring the unknown.

## Introduction
A collection of papers and their corresponding repositories for indexing papers on arxiv that have published project code or coming soon.

We hope that the authors of the relevant papers will actively add and update information here as a list to promote broader and more comprehensive discussions.

## RoadMap
- [Artificial Intelligence](repo.cs.AI.md)
- [Computation and Language](repo.cs.CL.md)
- [Cryptography and Security](repo.cs.CR.md)
- [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition](repo.cs.CV.md)
- [Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing](repo.cs.DC.md)
- [Human-Computer Interaction](repo.cs.HC.md)
- [Machine Learning](repo.cs.LG.md)
- [Neural and Evolutionary Computing](repo.cs.NE.md)
- [Software Engineering](repo.cs.SE.md)
- [Quantum Physics](repo.quant-ph.md)

## Contribution
Such a file naming format is conducive to retrieval and classification.
```
repo.cs.CV.md
repo.cs.AI.md
```

Item format example:

- **title**
   [[id]](https://arxiv.org/abs/id)
   [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/id)
   [[repo]](https://github.com/) 
   - brief
   - author

Items should be sorted in chronological order,newer papers should be inserted from the head of the file.

## Proposals
- Consider whether Python crawlers can be used to automatically capture and generate MD files.
- Fork this repository to track the latest changes.
